title: Difficulty scale
---

This page explains the purpose of the difficulty scale used by this website
(preferably called “the college quizbowl calendar difficulty scale”).

Traditional <dfn>difficulty terms</dfn> like “Regular”
and vague qualifiers like “Fall-plus” or “Regular-minus”
are non-standard and confusing and should be deprecated
([read more](https://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=21177)).

<p>This site uses the following four-level scale:</p>

{% include scale.html %}

This scale was designed to be unambiguous and easy to communicate,
especially to people not well-versed in quizbowl.
It assumes that there are only a few fundamental levels in quizbowl’s difficulty progression.

If you plan to write a tournament,
please consider targeting one of these four difficulty levels.
Like overly long questions, difficulty creep is selfish and insular;
quizbowl does not need to be so hard.

Although difficulty varies on a continuous scale in reality,
please avoid using half-dots for rating your own tournament’s difficulty.
Please also avoid using the ambiguous abbreviation “regs.”
