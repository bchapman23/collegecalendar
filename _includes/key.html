<li class="ebol"><p><dfn>EBOL</dfn> is an inchoate idea for a “detailed stats league” for college quizbowl. The idea for EBOL is that participating sets will cooperate with Ophir and conform to a relatively consistent direction (such as distribution, difficulty, eligibility, rules, and format). At the end of the regular season, <a href="https://qbwiki.com/wiki/Detailed_stats">detailed stats</a> from all tournaments will be compared and outstanding achievements will be recognized. Please email Ophir if you want to help organize EBOL.</p></li>
